# RAG Answer Quality Improvements for Help Desk Agent

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to enhance the quality of answers generated by the AI-System-DocAI RAG system, specifically optimized for help desk agent use cases.

## Problem Statement
The system was producing low-quality, truncated answers that lacked the detailed step-by-step instructions needed for help desk support. 

**Example Issue:**
- **Before:** "To fix the sync issue, check if your PC is running at high resource usage and if the print spooler service is consuming most of the resources. If so, end the Print Spooler temporarily and restart it..."
- **Expected:** Complete detailed procedure with all numbered steps (1-6) and sub-steps, including specific commands, keyboard shortcuts, and menu paths.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Insufficient token limits** (600-800 tokens) for detailed multi-step procedures
2. **Generic prompts** that didn't emphasize complete step-by-step instructions
3. **Context truncation** (500 chars) losing important procedural details
4. **Answer extraction focused on summaries** rather than preserving full detailed instructions

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Token Limits
**Files Modified:** `src/config.py`

```python
# Changed from 600 to 2000 tokens
"max_tokens": 2000,  # Increased for detailed help desk answers
```

**Impact:** Allows LLM to generate complete, detailed procedures without truncation.

### 2. Enhanced Prompts for Help Desk Scenarios
**Files Modified:** `src/reasoning.py`, `src/streaming_reasoning.py`

**Key Improvements:**
- Added explicit requirements for help desk/troubleshooting answers
- Emphasized preservation of ALL steps and sub-steps
- Instructed to include specific details (keyboard shortcuts, menu paths, commands)
- Added formatting guidelines (numbered lists, sub-bullets, section headers)

**New Prompt Requirements:**
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HELP DESK / TROUBLESHOOTING ANSWERS:
- The FINAL ANSWER must be COMPLETE and DETAILED with ALL steps and sub-steps
- For troubleshooting issues, provide:
  * Clear identification of the Issue/Error
  * Explanation of the Cause (if provided in context)
  * COMPLETE Resolution steps with ALL numbered steps and sub-steps
  * Each step should include specific instructions (e.g., "Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc", "Type services.msc")
  * Include ALL details from the context - don't summarize or skip steps
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for main steps
- Use sub-bullets (o, -, •) for sub-steps within each main step
- Include keyboard shortcuts, menu paths, and specific actions
- Preserve the level of detail from the original documentation
- Do NOT truncate, summarize, or shorten the instructions
```

### 3. Fixed Context Truncation
**Files Modified:** `src/reasoning.py`, `src/streaming_reasoning.py`

**Before:**
```python
text = item.get("text", "")[:500]  # Limit length
```

**After:**
```python
text = item.get("text", "")[:2000]  # Increased to preserve detailed procedures
```

**Impact:** Preserves complete procedural details from source documents (4x increase).

### 4. Improved Answer Extraction
**Files Modified:** `src/reasoning.py`, `src/streaming_reasoning.py`

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `_extract_answer()` to capture ALL lines in FINAL ANSWER section
- Removed aggressive whitespace normalization that collapsed numbered steps
- Preserved indentation for sub-steps
- Changed from joining with spaces to preserving newlines
- Stopped only at explicit section markers, not generic keywords

**Before (aggressive extraction):**
```python
if line and not any(indicator in line.upper() for indicator in 
    ['STEP', 'REASONING:', 'ANALYSIS:', 'CONCLUSION:', 'NOTE:', 'IMPORTANT:']):
    answer_lines.append(line)
# Joined with spaces, collapsing structure
answer_text = '\n'.join(answer_lines).strip()
return self._format_answer_structure(answer_text)  # Over-formatted
```

**After (preserves structure):**
```python
# Collect ALL lines including numbered steps, sub-steps, and formatting
if final_answer_started:
    if any(marker in stripped_line.upper() for marker in 
        ['ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION', 'CONFIDENCE SCORE', '---END---']):
        break
    answer_lines.append(line.rstrip())  # Preserve structure

# Return with minimal formatting
return '\n'.join(answer_lines).strip()
```

### 5. Enhanced Answer Formatting
**Files Modified:** `src/reasoning.py`, `src/streaming_reasoning.py`

**Key Improvements:**
- Detects help desk answers with sections (Issue:, Cause:, Resolution:)
- Detects detailed procedures (numbered steps + sub-steps)
- Preserves original formatting for detailed procedures
- Only normalizes excessive whitespace
- Maintains indentation for hierarchical steps

**Detection Logic:**
```python
has_sections = any(section in answer for section in 
    ['Issue:', 'Error:', 'Cause:', 'Resolution:', 'Steps:', 'Procedure:'])
has_numbered_steps = bool(re.search(r'\d+\.\s+', answer))
has_substeps = any(marker in answer for marker in 
    ['\no\s', '\n-\s', '\n•\s', '\n  o', '\n  -'])

# If it's a detailed procedure, preserve the formatting
if (has_sections or (has_numbered_steps and len(answer) > 200)) and has_substeps:
    # Minimal formatting - just normalize excessive whitespace
    # Preserve structure and indentation
```

## Expected Results

### Before Improvements
```
To fix the sync issue, check if your PC is running at high resource usage 
and if the print spooler service is consuming most of the resources. If so, 
end the Print Spooler temporarily and restart it to free up system resources. 
Additionally, verify whether the handheld device is connected to the server. 
If not, go to the server, open the
```

### After Improvements
```
Issue:
Error: Execution time out expired, sync not starting

Cause: 
PC is running at high resource usage, and the print spooler service is 
consuming most of the resources.

Resolution:
1. Open Task Manager:
   o Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager, or right-click on the 
     taskbar and select "Task Manager."

2. Locate the Print Spooler:
   o In Task Manager, click on the "Processes" tab.
   o Look for "Print Spooler" or "spoolsv.exe" in the list of running processes.

3. End Task:
   o Right-click on "Print Spooler" and select End Task to stop the process 
     temporarily.

4. Restart the Print Spooler Service:
   o Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box.
   o Type services.msc and press Enter to open the Services window.
   o Scroll down to find Print Spooler.
   o Right-click on Print Spooler and select Restart.

5. Check the Printer Queue:
   o Go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers.
   o Make sure the printer queue is cleared. Cancel any stuck print jobs if 
     necessary.

6. Reboot the System (Optional):
   o If the issue persists, a system reboot might help free up resources.
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Procedural Coverage:** All steps from source documents are preserved
2. **Actionable Instructions:** Specific commands, shortcuts, and paths included
3. **Clear Structure:** Numbered steps with sub-steps maintain hierarchy
4. **No Truncation:** Sufficient token budget for lengthy procedures
5. **Professional Help Desk Quality:** Matches the level of detail in original documentation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various help desk scenarios (troubleshooting, how-to, configuration)
2. Verify that answers include ALL steps from source PDFs
3. Check that keyboard shortcuts and specific commands are preserved
4. Ensure proper formatting of numbered lists and sub-steps
5. Validate that cause/issue/resolution structure is maintained

## Configuration

Users can adjust token limits in `config.toml` or through the configuration UI:

```toml
[reasoning]
max_tokens = 2000  # Adjust based on complexity of procedures

[llm]
max_tokens = 2000  # Should match reasoning.max_tokens
```

## Notes

- Token limits can be increased further if needed (e.g., 3000) for extremely detailed procedures
- The system automatically detects help desk answer patterns and preserves formatting
- For non-procedural questions, the system still applies appropriate formatting
- Source citations are automatically added at the end of answers

## Files Modified

1. `src/config.py` - Increased token limits
2. `src/reasoning.py` - Enhanced prompts, extraction, and formatting
3. `src/streaming_reasoning.py` - Enhanced prompts, extraction, and formatting for streaming mode
